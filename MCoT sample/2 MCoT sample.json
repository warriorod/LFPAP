        "Patient Descrition":"A 76-year-old male patient underwent mitral valve replacement, left atrial reconstruction, aortic valve exploration, and temporary epicardial pacing lead placement in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery. The patient had a history of using ACEI/ARB medications and was classified as ASA grade 3. Preoperative blood tests indicated the following renal function parameters: uric acid level of 299.9 μmol/L, BUN level of 9.0 mmol/L, cystatin C level of 1.75 mg/L, and creatinine level of 52.3 μmol/L. Liver function parameters included alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 11.4 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 15.3 U/L, direct bilirubin level of 12.7 μmol/L, and total bilirubin level of 39.5 μmol/L. The patient's glucose level was 9.58 mmol/L, and creatine kinase (CK) level was 389.8 U/L. The indicators that indirectly reflect inflammation showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.17 × 10⁹/L, lymphocyte count of 1.61 × 10⁹/L, and neutrophil count of 7.75 × 10⁹/L. Coagulation parameters included prothrombin time (PT) of 17.7 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 55.7 seconds.During surgery, the patient received general anesthesia. The duration of the surgery was 440.0 minutes, with an anesthesia duration of 400.0 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss was 2000.0 mL, urine output was 800.0 mL, total output was 2800 mL, and total input was 3650.0 mL. The patient experienced no intraoperative hypotension (diastolic pressure 50-60 mmHg) and had 100 minutes of hypothermia (temperature 34-36°C) and 80 minutes of low SpO2 (pulse oximetry 70-90%). Vasopressors and glucocorticoids were administered during the procedure. Cardiac output monitoring and arterial puncture were also performed during the surgery",
        "Medical Rationale":"Patient's Age and Comorbidities: The patient is 76 years old, which inherently increases the risk for postoperative complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI). The history of using ACEI/ARB medications and an ASA grade of 3 indicate significant underlying cardiovascular disease, further elevating the risk for renal complications. Preoperative Renal Function Indicators: Preoperative blood tests showed a uric acid level of 299.9 μmol/L, which is moderately elevated and could contribute to renal stress. The BUN level was 9.0 mmol/L, which is slightly elevated, indicating potential renal impairment. A cystatin C level of 1.75 mg/L suggests reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), signifying impaired kidney function. However, the creatinine level was 52.3 μmol/L, which is within normal limits but must be interpreted cautiously in the context of other elevated markers.\n\nPreoperative Liver Function Indicators: The patient's liver function tests showed an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 11.4 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 15.3 U/L, both within normal ranges. However, the direct bilirubin level was 12.7 μmol/L and total bilirubin level was 39.5 μmol/L, both elevated, indicating potential hepatic or biliary dysfunction, which can indirectly affect renal function.\n\nPreoperative Glucose and Muscle Enzyme Levels: The glucose level was 9.58 mmol/L, indicating hyperglycemia, which can exacerbate renal stress and contribute to the development of AKI. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 389.8 U/L, suggesting muscle breakdown or stress, which could be a contributing factor to renal impairment.\n\nInflammatory and Hematologic Indicators:The white blood cell (WBC) count was 10.17 x10^9/L, lymphocyte count was 1.61 x10^9/L, and neutrophil count was 7.75 x10^9/L, all of which suggest an inflammatory response that could impact renal function.\n\nCoagulation Profile: The prothrombin time (PT) was 17.7 seconds and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 55.7 seconds, both prolonged, indicating a potential coagulopathy which can complicate surgery and postoperative recovery. \n\nIntraoperative Factors: The surgery was lengthy, lasting 440 minutes, with an anesthesia duration of 400 minutes, significantly increasing the risk of intraoperative and postoperative complications. The patient had substantial intraoperative blood loss (2000 mL) and urine output was 800 mL, indicating a considerable fluid shift and potential for renal hypoperfusion. The total fluid input was 3650 mL, which suggests aggressive fluid management but is still a concern for renal function. The patient had 100 minutes of hypothermia (temperature 34-36°C) and 80 minutes of low SpO2 (oxygen saturation 70-90%), both of which can adversely affect renal perfusion and oxygenation, heightening the risk for AKI.\n\nUse of Medications: The administration of vasopressors and glucocorticoids during the procedure indicates attempts to manage hemodynamics and reduce inflammation, but their use also highlights the critical nature of the patient's condition.\n\nMonitoring Requirements: The need for cardiac output monitoring and arterial puncture during the surgery underscores the patient's high-risk status and the necessity for meticulous hemodynamic monitoring, which is often associated with an increased risk of complications, including AKI.\n\nOverall, due to the advanced age, significant comorbidities (ASA grade 3), elevated preoperative inflammatory markers (CRP), prolonged surgery and anesthesia duration, substantial intraoperative blood loss, periods of hypothermia and low SpO2, and the need for intensive intraoperative monitoring, this patient is at high risk of developing postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). These factors collectively contribute to potential renal ischemia and compromised renal function.",

        "Patient Descrition":"A 76-year-old male patient underwent a transurethral ureteral stent placement (bilateral) in the urology department. The patient's ASA rating was between 1 and 2. Preoperative blood routine examination  indicated the patient's renal function: uric acid level was 210.3 μmol/L, BUN level was 4.4 mmol/L, cystatin C level was 1.04 mg/L, and preoperative creatinine level was 59.9 μmol/L. Preoperative blood routine examination  also reflected the patient's liver function: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 6.8 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 13.0 U/L, direct bilirubin level was 3.1 μmol/L, and total bilirubin level was 8.7 μmol/L. In the preoperative blood routine examination , the patient's glucose level was 4.73 mmol/L, and creatine kinase level was 78.1 U/L. The preoperative blood routine examination  also indicated the patient's inflammatory status: white blood cell count was 5.52 × 10⁹/L, lymphocyte count was 1.43 × 10⁹/L, and neutrophil count was 3.77 × 10⁹/L. In the preoperative blood routine examination , the patient's prothrombin time was 10.6 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 22.6 seconds.",
        "Medical Rationale":"Patient's Age and ASA Rating: The patient is a 76-year-old male, placing him in a higher age bracket that generally carries an increased risk for postoperative complications. However, his ASA rating of 1 to 2 indicates he is relatively healthy with mild systemic disease, suggesting a lower baseline risk for acute complications such as AKI.\n\nPreoperative Renal Function Indicators: The patient’s preoperative renal function tests are within normal ranges. Uric acid level is 210.3 μmol/L, BUN level is 4.4 mmol/L, cystatin C level is 1.04 mg/L, and creatinine level is 59.9 μmol/L. These values suggest that the kidneys are functioning adequately without signs of significant impairment or stress.\n\nPreoperative Liver Function Indicators: The liver function tests show alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 6.8 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 13.0 U/L, both within normal ranges, indicating no acute hepatic injury. Direct bilirubin level of 3.1 μmol/L and total bilirubin level of 8.7 μmol/L, while slightly elevated, do not suggest significant hepatic dysfunction.\n\nPreoperative Glucose and Muscle Enzyme Levels: The glucose level of 4.73 mmol/L is within normal range, indicating controlled blood sugar levels. The creatine kinase (CK) level of 78.1 U/L is also within normal range, suggesting no significant muscle breakdown or stress.\n\nInflammatory and Hematologic Indicators: The white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.52 x 10^9/L, lymphocyte count of 1.43 x 10^9/L, and neutrophil count of 3.77 x 10^9/L are all within normal ranges, suggesting a stable immune status.\n\nCoagulation Profile: The prothrombin time (PT) of 10.6 seconds and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 22.6 seconds indicate normal coagulation function.\n\nIntraoperative Factors: The surgery was relatively short, with a duration of 52 minutes, and the anesthesia duration was 34 minutes. There was no blood loss, urine output, or total output during the surgery, while the total input was 500 mL, indicating adequate fluid management. Importantly, the patient experienced only 20 minutes of hypotension (diastolic blood pressure 50-60 mmHg) and 15 minutes of hypothermia (body temperature 34-36°C), both of which are relatively short durations and less likely to significantly impact renal perfusion. There were no episodes of low SpO2 (oxygen saturation 70-90%), indicating stable oxygenation throughout the procedure.\n\nOverall, due to his relatively healthy status (ASA rating of 1 to 2) and normal preoperative renal function indicators, including uric acid, urea, cystatin C, and creatinine levels, this patient is at low risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) postoperatively. The surgery was short, with minimal intraoperative hypotension and hypothermia, and stable oxygenation, further reducing the risk of AKI.",
